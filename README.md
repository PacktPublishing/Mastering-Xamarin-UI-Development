#Mastering Xamarin UI Development
This is the code repository for [Mastering Xamarin UI Development](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-xamarin-ui-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786462008), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Xamarin is the most powerful cross-platform mobile development framework. If you are interested in creating stunning user interfaces for the iOS and Android mobile platforms using the power of Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms, then this is your ticket.

##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter 02.



The code will look like the following:

```

// WalkEntryViewModel.cs
// TrackMyWalks ViewModels

namespace TrackMyWalks
{
  public class WalkEntryViewModel : WalkBaseViewModel
  {
```


The minimum requirement for this book is an Intel-based Macintosh computer running OS
X El Capitan 10.11. We will be using Xamarin Studio 6.1.2, which is the Integrated
Development Environment (IDE) used for creating Xamarin.Forms applications using C#,
as well as Xcode 8.2.1 to compile our iOS app and run this within the simulator.
Almost all the projects that you create with the help of this book will work and run on the
iOS simulator. However, some projects will require an iOS or Android device to work
correctly. You can download the latest versions of Xamarin Studio and Xcode at:
[Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/download)
[Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
